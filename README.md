# BoneAge
This system automates bone age prediction from hand X-ray images using a deep learning pipeline. Leveraging a ResNet50 model and techniques like CLAHE preprocessing and data augmentation, it achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of approximately 6.2 months. The system offers a streamlined workflow for automated bone age assessment and diagnostics.
